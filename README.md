Pewter is an open source project to send or gift ethers with personalized messages.
## NTWoC Project Details

### Abstract
Pewter is a platform whcih allows you to add a personalized message or video when sending money(ethers) on the Ethereum Blockchain. 
The main use case include attaching a gift card or a video message when gifting money to a loved one. The application will combine the user's message and money(ether) to form an ERC721 Non-Fungible Token and make it transferable . The project is intended to implement ['Paypal's gift money with designer cards'](https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/06/paypal-now-lets-you-send-designed-cards-when-gifting-money-this-holiday-season/) for the Ethereum Ecosystem. 

#### What is an ERC721 Non-Fungible Token?
ERC721 is a token standard for the Ethereum Blockchain where each token is unique and non-interchangeable with other tokens. The initial purpose of the standard was to make [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/). In this project ERC721 can be used to represent the message and the associated ether as a single token. The ownership of this token can then be transferred to anyone.

### Skill Requirements (You can apply if you have any one of the skills mentioned below)
1) Smart Contract Developer: Should work on the logic for ERC721 generation and transfer
2) Smart Contract Auditor: Should audit the contracts and implement security measures
3) Front-End Developer: Should work on building the web-app for the project
4) Integration: Should work on the Web UI interaction with the smart contract


### Ideas that can be implemented
1) Allow the user to upload/record video and directly upload to IPFS. 
2) The user generated ERC721 token's metadata can store the IPFS hash of the message to send.
3) Use OpenZeppelin's library for the ERC721 contract.
4) Allow recievers to redeem ethers and keep the tokens as collectibles. The collectibles can denote memory.
5) Choose MetaMask/Infura/uPort for signing the transactions.
6) Build a web-app with an easy to use interface.

### New Ideas
Do not hesitate to introduce new ideas.We will discuss and chalk out the best way to the last stop.
